# DecodingUs Rust rewrite — status & handoff

Living snapshot of the Play/Scala 3 → Rust port. Pairs with `README.md` (roadmap)
and the plan at `~/.claude/plans/robust-knitting-lampson.md`. Last updated after
the tree-versioning + merge work.

## TL;DR

The **spine is done**: redesigned schema, data layer, public HTML/HTMX surface,
auth + curator tools, the full production ETL, the public JSON API, and tree
versioning + merge (end-to-end). The big remaining mass is **federation HTTP
endpoints**. Several subsystems are intentionally absent (see "Out of scope").

Measured against the *full* legacy Scala app this is still less than half by
surface area — but most of the missing half is either deliberately gone (moved to
Navigator/edge, or not in production) or concentrated in federation.

## Layout

- **`/Users/jkane/Development/decodingus/rust`** — this workspace (AppView-only crates).
  - `du-db`, `du-external`, `du-web`, `du-jobs`, `du-migrate`
- **`/Users/jkane/Development/decodingus-shared/crates`** — shared crates, separate git repo.
  - `du-domain` (pure types + algorithms, incl. `merge`), `du-atproto`, `du-bio`
  - Pushed to `github.com/JamesKane/decodingus-shared`; consumed via **git deps
    pinned to a rev** in `rust/Cargo.toml` (Docker build unblocked — no sibling
    path dep needed). To update: push the shared repo, then bump `rev` (or switch
    to a pushed tag, e.g. `v0.1.0` — created locally, not yet pushed). For local
    co-dev against working-tree changes, add a `[patch]` back to the sibling paths.
- Legacy Scala app: `/Users/jkane/Development/decodingus` (parent dir). Navigator:
  `/Users/jkane/Development/scala/DUNavigator`.

## Local dev / how to run

Postgres runs under Apple `container` (name `du-pg`), reachable at its own IP
(no localhost forwarding):

```
DATABASE_URL="postgres://postgres:dev@192.168.64.2:5432/decodingus?sslmode=disable"
APP_SECRET="<any 32+ char string>"   # signs session cookies
```

- Run web: `DATABASE_URL=... APP_SECRET=... PORT=9000 cargo run -p du-web` (binary `decodingus`).
- Tests: `DATABASE_URL=... cargo test -p du-db` (live-DB tests skip/pass if unset).
  - `du-domain` tests need no DB (`cargo test -p du-domain`).
- Migrations auto-apply on web/ETL startup; the `du-db` migrations test also applies them.
- **Gotcha:** if a *committed* migration changes, recreate the dev DB
  (`decodingus`) — sqlx errors on a checksum mismatch (`VersionMismatch`).

### Databases in use
- `decodingus` — dev DB (migrations + live tests).
- `decodingus_legacy` — loaded from `scripts/mock-legacy.sql` (current-schema mock).
- `decodingus_etl` — ETL target (the migrate binary recreates/migrates it).

## What's done (✅)

- **Schema** — `migrations/0001–0010`. JSONB "document columns" (variant
  coordinates/aliases, biosample source_attrs/atproto, haplogroup provenance,
  coverage, …). `ident.audit_log` added in 0010.
- **`du-db`** — query modules for every aggregate (variant, haplogroup,
  biosample, publication, genome_region, coverage, proposal, study, change_set,
  merge, auth).
- **Public HTML/HTMX** (`du-web/routes`) — variants browser, Y/MT tree,
  references + per-pub biosamples, biosample map (PostGIS), coverage benchmarks;
  i18n (en/es/fr), `HX-Request` fragment negotiation, vendored assets.
- **Auth + curator** — signed-cookie sessions, `Curator` RBAC extractor, curator
  CRUD for haplogroups/variants/genome-regions, curation proposal
  intake→review→promote.
- **ETL** (`du-migrate`) — **full production surface**: catalog (donors,
  biosamples, variants, tree, studies, publications), ident/auth, genomics.
  Validated vs `db.schema` (schema-only) and the current-schema mock with data;
  all aggregates reconcile.
- **Public JSON API** (`du-web/api.rs`) — 16 read endpoints under `/api/v1/*` +
  OpenAPI 3 + Swagger UI at `/api` (utoipa). Clean DTOs. Includes the federated
  population reports `/api/v1/reports/{coverage,ancestry,haplogroups}` aggregated
  from the `fed.*` mirror with query-time SQL.
- **Tree versioning** (`du-db/change_set.rs`, `du-web/routes/versioning.rs`) —
  change-set lifecycle (DRAFT→READY_FOR_REVIEW→UNDER_REVIEW→APPLIED/DISCARDED),
  per-change review/approve-all, diff, and a temporal apply engine
  (CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE/REPARENT/VARIANT_EDIT). Curator-gated management API at
  `/manage/change-sets/*` (machine callers; **not** under the public `/api/v1`)
  **plus a two-panel HTMX review UI** at `/curator/change-sets`
  (`du-web/routes/change_sets.rs`). Integration-tested.
- **Tree merge** (`du-domain/merge.rs` + `du-db/merge.rs`) — pure Identify-Match-
  Graft re-implementation (subtree-scoped matching = recurrent-SNP guard;
  full-match / contraction+downflow / descendant / new / ambiguity-flagged).
  `materialize` → change-set via placeholder-chained `tree_change`; apply resolves
  placeholders. Endpoints `/manage/haplogroups/merge[/preview]`.
  Fixtures + end-to-end tests pass.
- **`du-bio`** — BED callable-loci, UCSC chain liftover, VCF reader, YBrowse ingest.
- **`du-bio`** — BED callable-loci, UCSC chain liftover, VCF reader, YBrowse ingest.
- **Federated reporting mirror** (`du-db/src/fed/`, `du-jobs/jetstream.rs`,
  migrations 0011–0012) — the AppView **aggregates and reports; it does not
  analyze.** A long-lived Jetstream consumer mirrors Navigator's published
  anonymized computed-summary records (the legacy `✅ AppView Complete` set:
  alignment coverage, biosample, sequencerun, project, workspace, genotype,
  populationBreakdown, haplogroupReconciliation) into dedicated `fed.*` reporting
  tables keyed `(did, rkey)`. Cursor-resumed, reconnecting, idempotent+ordered
  upsert; reports aggregate via query-time SQL (`coverage::aggregate_by_build`,
  `analytics::super_population_distribution`). **Privacy:** PII-bearing records
  (biosample/sequencerun/project/workspace) keep typed anonymized columns only —
  no raw JSONB, so donorIdentifier/accession/description/file paths can't leak;
  analytics records keep the computed payload minus `files`. **Not** the dropped
  full-CRUD raw-data mirror (summaries only). Live-DB + unit tested (incl. PII
  drop). The reporting **web endpoints** over these tables (flow c) are next.
- **Y-STR per-branch signatures (Phase 1)** — STR brought back into scope (2026-06).
  `fed.str_profile` mirror (Jetstream, `com.decodingus.atmosphere.strProfile`,
  lossless markers JSONB) + `du-db::ystr` modal-haplotype aggregation (scores
  simple + multi-copy; complex preserved unscored) → `tree.haplogroup_ancestral_str`
  (widened, mig 0013) via the `str-signature-recompute` job, joined through
  `fed.biosample.y_haplogroup`. Read at `GET /api/v1/haplogroups/:name/str-signature`.
  MANUAL overrides survive recompute. **Phase 2 DONE:** STR→branch prediction
  (`ystr::predict` — ranks branches by stepwise genetic distance to each modal
  signature, min-compared gate) at `POST /api/v1/str/predict` (lexicon markers in
  → ranked branches + `wgs_upgrade_recommended` nudge, true unless WGS-derived).
  **STR-based age (contributing factor, McDonald 2021) DONE:** `ystr::compute_str_age`
  (TMRCA = Σ|obs−modal|/Σµ × 33yr, per-marker rate from `genomics.str_mutation_rate`
  or a documented default, rate-uncertainty CI) folded into the recompute →
  `tree.haplogroup_age_estimate` (method `STR_VARIANCE`, mig 0014); read at
  `GET /api/v1/haplogroups/:name/age`. Deliberately a **labeled contributing
  estimate**, NOT the authoritative `tmrca_ybp` — a future combiner merges
  SNP/STR/genealogical factors (see `decodingus/documents/proposals/branch-age-
  estimation.md`). `str_mutation_rate` ships empty (uses the default until a
  Ballantyne/Willems import lands). Unit + live-DB tested.
- **`du-jobs`** — tokio scheduler; jobs: `db-heartbeat`, `ybrowse-variant-ingest`,
  `publication-update`, `publication-discovery`, `ena-study-enrichment`,
  `publication-pubmed-update`, `str-signature-recompute`; plus the Jetstream
  reporting-mirror consumer (set `JETSTREAM_URL`; runs beside the scheduler).
- **`du-external`** — OpenAlex, ENA; AWS SES + Secrets Manager behind the `aws`
  feature (1h TTL secret cache).
- **`du-atproto`** — DID/handle resolution, Ed25519 verify, PKCE/DPoP/private-key-
  JWT OAuth client + metadata builders (library; HTTP surface not wired — see below).

## What's left, in scope (⬜)

Roughly in priority order:

1. **Federation — AppView aggregates + reports (NOT the legacy PDS fleet, NOT a
   raw-data mirror).** The `fed.pds_node` / `pds_heartbeat` / fleet-admin tables
   (migration 0008) map to the **dropped** network-mirror design — don't build
   registration / heartbeat / fleet endpoints. The federated flows: **(a) proposal
   intake + curator review queue — DONE** (`/manage/curation/proposals` X-API-Key
   intake → `tree.proposed_branch` → `/curator/proposals` review/promote);
   **(b) reporting-mirror ingest — DONE** (Jetstream → `fed.*` reporting tables for
   the full `✅ AppView Complete` summary set, see "What's done"); **(c) reporting
   web endpoints — DONE** (`/api/v1/reports/{coverage,ancestry,haplogroups}`,
   query-time SQL over the mirror). More report shapes can be added over the other
   `fed.*` tables (genotype provider mix, platform/test-type distribution, …) as
   the UI needs them. See memory
   `atproto-federation-direction` for the full re-scope + privacy boundary.
2. **Live AT Protocol OAuth handshake** — `du-web/oauth.rs`, now with a **dev
   public-client path** (`/login/atproto/dev`, env-gated: `DU_OAUTH_DEV_PDS` +
   `DU_OAUTH_DEV_CA`/`DU_OAUTH_DEV_RESOLVE` + `DU_OAUTH_LOOPBACK`) that trusts a
   local CA + pins a host so a TLS-proxied PDS at its canonical `https://` name
   works. **Verified against a local PDS** (gated test
   `decodingus-shared/.../tests/live_pds.rs`): discovery + PAR + DPoP +
   `use_dpop_nonce` → `request_uri`, then with a Caddy TLS proxy the full handshake
   over canonical `https://pds.test` up to the **authorize page (loopback client
   accepted)**. The public flow's remainder is only the human **consent click**
   (browser-gated) → `code` → token (token path wired). **Confidential web-client
   — our side VERIFIED:** `client-metadata.json`/`jwks.json` spec-correct (live),
   and `client_assertion`/DPoP/PKCE unit-tested. The PDS-fetches-metadata +
   `private_key_jwt`-PAR round-trip can't run locally (Apple `container` has no
   `--add-host` for the PDS to resolve our `client_id` host) → it's the **Edge
   joint test**; plan + per-side checklist in `docs/atproto-oauth-findings.md`.
   Runbook + manual-browser steps there too.
3. **Scheduled jobs** — **`ena-study-enrichment` DONE** (`du-jobs/ena.rs` +
   `du-db::study::{needing_ena_enrichment,apply_ena_metadata}`): fills
   title/center/first-public gaps in `pubs.genomic_study` from the public ENA
   portal, daily, batched, idempotent (COALESCE; never clobbers curated values).
   Live-DB tested + ENA portal contract verified. Remaining are low-value/out of
   scope: `variant-export` (the `/api/v1/variants/export` endpoint already streams
   CSV live), `match-discovery` (IBD — not in production).
4. **Curator HTML UI for change-sets/merge review — DONE.** Two-panel HTMX screen
   at `/curator/change-sets` (`du-web/routes/change_sets.rs` + templates/curator/
   change-sets/*): list w/ status filter, review panel with diff summary+entries,
   per-change approve/reject, comments, and the lifecycle actions (start-review,
   approve-all, apply, discard) gated by status — mirrors the proposals screen.
   The JSON management API in `versioning.rs` remains for machine callers.
5. **Secondary web surfaces** — DONE: static pages (about/FAQ/terms/privacy +
   app-password help, `du-web/routes/pages.rs` + templates/static/page.html),
   `sitemap.xml` + `robots.txt`, footer nav, and the GDPR **cookie-consent banner**
   (JS-shown when no consent cookie; `POST /cookie-consent` → `ident.cookie_consents`
   via `du_db::consent`). Terms/privacy prose is placeholder pending legal review.
   Also DONE: **profile** page (`/profile`, authed read-only — name/roles/DID/handle/
   email/member-since) and the **contact/support** form (`/contact` → `support.
   contact_message` via `du_db::support`, reCAPTCHA-verified when configured).
   STILL TODO: **my-messages** (rides the `social.*` schema — out of scope, not in
   production).
6. **reCAPTCHA** — wired into the contact form: server-side siteverify when
   `RECAPTCHA_SECRET`/`RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY` are set, skipped in dev when unset
   (just needs prod keys). **NCBI/PubMed client — DONE** (`du-external::ncbi`,
   E-utilities esummary by PMID): the `publication-pubmed-update` job
   (`du-jobs/publications.rs`, env-gated on `NCBI_EMAIL`) fills journal/authors/
   date/doi gaps via `du-db::publication::update_pubmed` (gap-fill COALESCE,
   UNIQUE-safe DOI), complementing OpenAlex's by-DOI enrichment. Unit + live-DB
   tested; live esummary contract verified.
7. **Management API namespace (DECIDED 2026-06):** curator/machine endpoints are
   **not** under the public `/api/v1` — they live under **`/manage/*`**
   (`/manage/change-sets/*`, `/manage/haplogroups/merge[/preview]`,
   `/manage/curation/proposals`) and are deliberately excluded from the public
   OpenAPI doc. A separate internal/curator OpenAPI document is optional and not
   built (low priority).
8. **WIP shadow-table staging UI** — `tree.wip_*` tables exist but are unused;
   merge takes the simpler placeholder path. Only needed for a richer curator
   pre-apply editing flow.

## Out of scope / deliberately absent (➖)

- **Manual sample-ingestion APIs** (standard/PGP/external biosample create +
  sequences + publication-link) — curators use Navigator now; the AppView keeps
  catalog **review + naming** only.
- **BAM/CRAM extraction + variant calling** — done at the edge (Navigator); the
  AppView aggregates summaries/proposals (so `du-bio` is text + coordinate math, no htslib/noodles).
- **IBD/matching, patronage/billing, social/reputation** — not in production yet
  (schemas `0007`/`0009` exist as placeholders; no ETL, no endpoints).

## Cutover blocker

The 35MB `/Volumes/nas/stuff/dump.sql` **predates** the current `~/db.schema`
(no `tree` schema, `citizen_biosample_did` vs `at_uri`, no `*_result` columns).
So the ETL is validated against a current-schema mock, **not** real data. Before
cutover: get a **current-schema dump** or do a **read-only EC2 rehearsal**
(production runs on a self-managed EC2 instance), then `decodingus-migrate
--verify`.

## Key decisions & gotchas (don't relearn these)

- **Tree merge was buggy in legacy** → re-implemented against curated fixtures,
  NOT golden-tested against legacy output. Conservative: flag ambiguities, don't guess.
- **Merge materialization** uses `tree_change` + negative placeholders through the
  tested apply engine; the `wip_*` tables are reserved for a future staging UI.
- **Temporal DELETE**: nodes are temporal (`valid_until`); DELETE expires the node
  and `roots`/`children`/`subtree`/`existing_tree` exclude expired nodes.
- **Enums** fetched as `::text` + parsed (`parse_pg_enum`); JSONB via `Json<T>`.
- **utoipa** kept out of `du-domain` (shared with Navigator/edge); API DTOs +
  `From` impls live in `du-web/api.rs`. Recursive `HaplogroupNodeDto.children`
  needs `#[schema(no_recursion)]` or schema-gen stack-overflows at startup.
- **Management API auth**: session/`Curator` (legacy used X-API-Key). Unauth →
  303 to /login even for JSON endpoints.
- **`DbError::Conflict` → HTTP 422** (mapped in `du-web/error.rs`).
- **ETL preserves PKs** via `OVERRIDING SYSTEM VALUE` + `sample_guid`; sequences
  fixed up post-load; idempotent upserts.

## Resume checklist

1. `eval "$(./scripts/test-db.sh up)"` (or set `DATABASE_URL`); confirm `du-pg`
   container is running.
2. `cargo test --workspace` (du-domain needs no DB; du-db live tests need DATABASE_URL).
3. Pick the next arc — **federation endpoints** is the recommended next mass.
4. Reload the mock if needed: recreate `decodingus_legacy`, load
   `scripts/mock-legacy.sql`; recreate `decodingus_etl`; run `decodingus-migrate`.
