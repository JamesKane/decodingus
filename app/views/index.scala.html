        <h1>Welcome to Decoding Us</h1>
        <p>Decoding Us will be a next-generation platform for citizen science focused on empowering individuals to
            contribute to genealogical and population studies using Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) data and compatible
            technologies. Recognizing the limitations of centralized data silos and the growing importance of user data
            sovereignty, Decoding Us will be architected as a federated system, placing control and ownership firmly in
            the hands of the participants. This approach will foster greater trust, encourage broader participation,
            and unlock new possibilities for collaborative discovery in understanding our shared human history.</p>
        <p>The system shall be architected with these goals:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Federated Design:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Identity: </strong> Users will possess permanent decentralized identifiers for their
                    accounts using the robust and user-centric <a href="#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@@ATProtocol</a>.
                    This ensures portability and long-term control over their digital identity within the ecosystem.</li>
                <li><strong>Personal Data Stores (PDS):</strong> Participation will involve users securely sharing their
                    sequencing data through software operating on their own infrastructure â€“ be it a personal computer,
                    a dedicated Virtual Private Server (VPS), or potentially even services offered by their sequencing
                    vendors. This personal data store remains under the user's direct ownership, offering the
                    flexibility to migrate between providers as needed. The software running on the PDS will manage
                    data storage, facilitate secure communication with the network, and potentially perform initial
                    data processing tasks.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Secure Computing:</strong> The system will prioritize user privacy by enabling participating
                individuals to compare specific genetic features, such as Single Nucleotide Variant (SNV) values
                downstream of identified Y or mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroups, in a privacy-preserving manner.
                The necessary genetic features for comparison will be exchanged with potential matches through
                end-to-end encrypted messages. Specialized applications running on the user's PDS can then perform
                the computationally intensive comparisons, with a mechanism for consensus checking among peers to
                ensure the reliability of the results. This secure exchange ensures that sensitive raw genomic data
                remains within the user's control.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Looking Ahead:</strong> While the initial focus is on WGS data, the federated architecture of
            Decoding Us is designed to be extensible, potentially accommodating other compatible genomic or
            related data types in the future. We envision a vibrant community of citizen scientists collaborating on
            research questions, sharing insights, and contributing to a deeper understanding of human history and
            population dynamics, all within a framework that prioritizes data ownership, privacy, and security.</p>
