            <p>The haplogroup trees and related information on this Website are generated and enhanced by integrating data from multiple sources, including aggregated, non-personally identifiable data obtained from a private federation of genetic genealogy researchers operating AT Protocol Personal Data Server (PDS) applications, <strong>and publicly available genetic data from repositories such as the <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">European Nucleotide Archive</a> and <a href="https://my.pgp-hms.org/public_genetic_data" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PGP: Harvard</a>. This integration allows for broader population coverage and more comprehensive branch identification.</strong> The data from the private federation is made publicly available by the researchers within their <abbr title="Personal Data Store">PDS</abbr> privacy controls and is crawled by Decoding-Us.com. Publicly available data from repositories is accessed and integrated according to their respective terms of use.</p>
