    The Decoding Us Reputation System is designed to foster a high-quality, trustworthy community for genetic genealogy and research.
    It rewards positive contributions and protects the community from spam and abuse.
</p>

<h3>How it Works</h3>
<p>
    Every user starts with a neutral reputation score. As you contribute to the platform, your score increases.
    Conversely, actions that harm the community may lower your score.
    Higher scores unlock advanced features, ensuring that powerful tools are used by trusted members.
</p>
