# Decoding Us
A secure platform for genetic genealogy and population research, built with Play Framework and Scala 3.

NOTICE: This is just a place-holder code repository while working out architecture.

## Overview

This platform provides a secure infrastructure for genetic genealogists and researchers to:
- Host sequencing data files
- Access computational resources
- Perform relational analysis on genetic data
- Collaborate on population research studies

## Purpose

Decoding Us is a next generation citizen science platform for population research, which aims to bridge the gap between citizen scientists and researchers in the field of genetic genealogy. By providing a secure and scalable platform, we enable collaborative research while maintaining strict data privacy and security standards.

## Key Features

- Secure file hosting for genetic sequencing data
- Computational resources for analysis
- Relational analysis capabilities
- Research collaboration tools

## Technologies
