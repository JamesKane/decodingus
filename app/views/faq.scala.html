                                due to run costs associated with file storage. The original warehouse was built on a fixed-cost, unlimited storage hosting
                                platform. When that provider changed the terms, the site was moved to AWS S3 as the trendline for costs was decreasing at a
                                rate similar to the growth in capacity needed for storing the raw data. This kept the run costs in-line up until 2020.  Recent
                                global political forces made it difficult to ensure funding of the original warehouse, so we made the decision to end that
                                project.  All the community-submitted data and user data were removed permanently.

                                While YDNA-Warehouse has been an important resource for the community, we encourage you to continue your genealogical and research
                                journeys through other platforms and tools in the field of Y-DNA and genetic research.  Do keep this site in mind as you explore
                                other options, since we will eventually provide a more robust and flexible analysis toolset for the community.

                                Currently, Decoding-Us.com is a website that aims to provide a platform to gather and share
                                information about genetic sequencing for the genealogical and genetic research community. The initial
                                focus is on building a federated platform for the analysis of publicly available academic WGS data. We
                                are providing alternative Y and Mitochondrial DNA trees and related information to support the
                                research community.

                                We are also designing an ambitious application built on AT Protocol's <abbr title="Personal Data Repository">
                                PDS</abbr>
                                that will allow researchers to collaborate on genealogical and genetic research. This application will
                                provide a platform for researchers to share information about their haplogroups, ancestral populations,
                                and existing matching networks.  There is a very early Alpha version of a tool set to provide common analysis
                                reports that can eventually indexed by the federation to recreate a more robust form of data sharing.

                                The shift to a federated platform allows us to provide a more robust and flexible analysis toolset
                                for the community without a centralized infrastructure for file hosting and analysis.  This paradigm
                                moves us closer to the citizen science paradigm explored by Seti@@Home and other distributed compute projects
                                from the past decades.  Spreading these costs solves the primary problem associated with the
                                YDNA-Warehouse project, while opening the possibility of a whole genome toolset for the community.
