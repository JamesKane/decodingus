            <p>The haplogroup trees and related information on this Website are generated and enhanced by integrating data from multiple sources, including aggregated, non-personally identifiable data obtained from a private federation of genetic genealogy researchers operating AT Protocol Personal Data Server (PDS) applications, <strong>
                and publicly available genetic data from repositories such as the <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                European Nucleotide Archive</a>

                . This integration allows for broader population coverage and more comprehensive branch identification.</strong>

            <p>Decoding-Us.com provides an Application View that allows researchers within the private federation using AT Protocol <abbr title="Personal Data Store">
                PDS</abbr>
                applications to communicate with each other based on shared genealogical and genetic information. This messaging feature is facilitated to encourage collaboration and potential relative matching. Users of the <abbr title="Personal Data Store">
                    PDS</abbr> control whether they receive and engage with these messages.</p>

                MDKA</abbr>
                ) information obtained from publicly shared data within the federation. This information is intended to provide genealogical context and facilitate connections among researchers. Please note that the <abbr title="Most Distant Known Ancestor">
                    MDKA</abbr>'s date of birth may be masked to protect potential privacy.</p>
