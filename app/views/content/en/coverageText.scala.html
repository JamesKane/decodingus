<p>
    Coverage statistics are calculated from sequencing reads aligned to the
    <a href="https://github.com/marbl/CHM13" target="_blank">chm13v2.0/hs1</a> reference genome
    using <a href="https://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">BWA-MEM</a>.
    A site is considered "callable" when it has at least four reads with high mapping confidence.

    <h5 class="alert-heading">Why This Matters</h5>
    <p>
        This analysis provides independent verification of sequencing quality from direct-to-consumer
        WGS test providers. When a company advertises "30x coverage" or "90Gb of data," these metrics
        help you verify:
    </p>
    <ul class="mb-0">
        <li><strong>Data quantity:</strong>
            Does the delivered data match the advertised amount and read length?</li>
        <li><strong>Data quality:</strong> Are the reads accurately aligned to the reference genome?</li>
        <li><strong>Usable coverage:</strong>
            How much of the genome can reliably be analyzed for variants?</li>
    </ul>

        Average number of reads per base position. Note: For sex chromosomes (X and Y),
        male samples typically show approximately half the advertised sequencing depth
        (e.g., ~15x coverage on X/Y for a 30x WGS) due to having only one copy of these chromosomes.
        Female samples should show the full advertised depth on the X chromosome (~30x for a 30x WGS)
        since they have two X chromosomes.
